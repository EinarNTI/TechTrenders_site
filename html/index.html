            <p class="moveFromBorder">Infineon Technologies has developed ultra-thin silicon wafers, only 20 micrometers thick, which are poised to
            significantly improve energy efficiency in AI applications. These wafers, thinner than a human hair, reduce power loss
            by over 15%, benefiting AI servers, motor controls, and consumer electronics. Infineon's innovation utilizes a unique
            grinding process to handle the challenges of such thin wafers while maintaining robustness. This advancement aligns with
            global trends in decarbonization and digitalization, enhancing the energy efficiency and reliability of AI-driven
            systems</p>

            <p class="moveFromBorder">TSMC's Arizona fabrication plant, built under the U.S. CHIPS Act, has achieved a 4% higher yield compared to similar
            facilities in Taiwan. The fab recently began producing 4nm chips for companies like Apple and AMD. This milestone
            highlights the U.S.'s efforts to reestablish domestic semiconductor manufacturing and secure its supply chain. Despite
            challenges in funding and workforce training, the facility now plays a critical role in meeting the rising demand for
            advanced chips, offering stability amid global disruptions</p>
