                <p class="moveFromBorder">Infineon Technologies has developed ultra-thin silicon wafers, only 20 micrometers thick, which are poised to
                significantly improve energy efficiency in AI applications. These wafers, thinner than a human hair, reduce power loss
                by over 15%, benefiting AI servers, motor controls, and consumer electronics. Infineon's innovation utilizes a unique
                grinding process to handle the challenges of such thin wafers while maintaining robustness. This advancement aligns with
                global trends in decarbonization and digitalization, enhancing the energy efficiency and reliability of AI-driven
                systems</p>

                <p class="moveFromBorder">TSMC's Arizona fabrication plant, built under the U.S. CHIPS Act, has achieved a 4% higher yield compared to similar
                facilities in Taiwan. The fab recently began producing 4nm chips for companies like Apple and AMD. This milestone
                highlights the U.S.'s efforts to reestablish domestic semiconductor manufacturing and secure its supply chain. Despite
                challenges in funding and workforce training, the facility now plays a critical role in meeting the rising demand for
                advanced chips, offering stability amid global disruptions</p>
